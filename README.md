# MC202: Data Structures Programming üßë‚Äçüíª
This repository contains a collection of C programming lab exercises. These were completed as part of the MC202 - Estruturas de Dados course at Unicamp in the second semester of 2024, focusing on fundamental programming concepts and data structures.

üìú Description
This repository serves as a personal archive of solutions to various programming challenges. The exercises primarily focus on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms using the C programming language ‚öôÔ∏è. Each lab tackles a specific problem or concept, providing practical application of theoretical knowledge.

üìÇ Repository Structure
The repository is organized into multiple directories, where each directory named `labXX` represents a distinct lab assignment or project.

For example:

- `lab01/`: Contains the first lab.
- `lab02/`: Contains the second lab.
- `...and so on.`

Each lab directory typically contains the C source code files (`.c`), header files (`.h` if any), and the makefile for the problem.

üß† Topics/Concepts Covered
This collection covers a range of fundamental computer science topics, including but not limited to:

- **Basic C Programming:** Syntax, control flow, functions, pointers.
- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks (`pilha.c`)
  - Queues (`heap.c` for priority queues)
  - Trees (`arvore.c`)
  - Hash Tables (`hash.c`)
  - Graphs (`grafo.c`)
- **Algorithms:**
  - Expression evaluation (e.g., using stacks and trees in `lab07/main.c`)
  - Sorting and searching (common in such lab series)
  - Graph traversal
  - Memory management
- **Problem Solving:** Applying these concepts to solve specific challenges presented in each lab.

This repository can be a valuable resource for understanding the practical implementation of these concepts in C.

ü§î How to Use
Each lab directory is structured as a standalone C project. To explore a specific lab:

1. Navigate into the lab's directory.
2. Review the C source code files (`.c`, `.h`).
3. Compile and execute the code using a C compiler like GCC.

This repository can be used for:

- Learning C programming through practical examples.
- Understanding implementations of common data structures and algorithms.
- Reference for similar academic exercises.
